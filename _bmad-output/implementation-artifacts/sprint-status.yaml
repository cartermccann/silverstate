# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created

# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

# PARALLEL EXECUTION OPPORTUNITIES:
# ==================================
# After Epic 1 core (1-1 through 1-8) is complete, these can run in parallel:
#   Track A: Epic 2 (Homepage) — 2-1 → 2-2 → 2-3
#   Track B: Epic 3 (Programs) — 3-1 → 3-2 → 3-3
#   Track C: Epic 4 (Conditions) — 4-1 → 4-2 → {4-3 || 4-4}
#   Track D: Epic 5 (Insurance) — 5-1 → 5-2
#   Track E: Epic 6 (About) — 6-1 → 6-2
#   Track F: Epic 7 (Locations) — 7-1 → 7-2
#   Track G: Epic 8 (Admissions) — 8-1 → 8-2 (needs 1-11 for serverless)
#   Track H: Epic 9 (Analytics) — 9-1 → 9-2 (needs 1-11 for GTM proxy)
#
# Recommended execution order for solo dev:
#   Phase 1: Epic 1 (Stories 1-1 through 1-12)
#   Phase 2: Epic 2 + Epic 3 data story (2-1, 3-1 in parallel)
#   Phase 3: Remaining Epic 2 + Epic 3 pages (2-2, 2-3, 3-2, 3-3)
#   Phase 4: Epic 4 + Epic 5 (4-1, 5-1 data first, then pages)
#   Phase 5: Epic 6 + Epic 7 (6-1, 7-1 data first, then pages)
#   Phase 6: Epic 8 (admissions + contact form)
#   Phase 7: Epic 9 (analytics + tracking — last because it integrates with everything)
