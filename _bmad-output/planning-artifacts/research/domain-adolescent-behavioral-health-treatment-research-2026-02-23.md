### Market Dynamics and Growth

**Growth Drivers:**
- ~20% of U.S. youth affected by mental health disorders; major depressive disorder impacts nearly 1 in 10 adolescents
- Nevada ranks **second to last nationally** for young people with major depressive episodes (22%+ vs 11% national average)
- Nevada consistently ranks **51st for youth mental health access** (Mental Health America) — massive unmet demand
- Rising awareness and diagnosis of behavioral health conditions
- Growing acceptance of mental health as critical aspect of overall wellness
- U.S. healthcare costs rose ~10% in 2025, expected to rise another 9.6% in 2026

**Growth Barriers:**
- Federal/state funding uncertainty — proposed $800B Medicaid cuts threaten inpatient behavioral health funding through 2030
- Workforce shortage — Nevada struggles to recruit and retain qualified mental health professionals
- U.S. DOJ investigation (Oct 2022) found Nevada lacks adequate community-based mental health services, leading to overutilization of higher levels of care
- Regulatory complexity and compliance costs increasing

**2026 Inflection Point:**
The industry is transitioning from **"growth mode" to "proof mode"** — measurement-based care, accountability, and defending clinical value are now the competitive differentiators. Payer demands and federal crackdown on waste, fraud, and abuse are driving providers to prove value via measurements and data. Clinical credibility, not just scale, is becoming the new competitive edge.

## Competitive Landscape

### Key Players and Market Leaders

**National Market Leaders (Adolescent Residential Treatment):**

**1. Newport Academy (DR 71 | 6,411 keywords | 40,322 monthly traffic)**
The dominant player in teen treatment. Joint Commission Gold Seal accredited. Multi-location model across California, Connecticut, Utah, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and more. Third-party outcome validation through Vanderbilt University — 50% reduction in teen depression and suicidal ideation. Gender-responsive residential, PHP, and IOP programs for ages 7-17. Uses Attachment-Based Family Therapy. Insurance-friendly. Staff-to-patient ratio is industry-leading.
_Key SEO Strategy: Location-specific pages drive massive branded traffic (e.g., "newport academy connecticut" = 369 traffic, "newport academy utah" = 324 traffic). Resource content on teen-adjacent topics (e.g., "scromiting" = 1,817 traffic from a single page, "yolo meaning" = 314 traffic, "adolescent egocentrism" = 274 traffic). Quizzes ("anxiety test for teens" = 231 traffic) as top-of-funnel engagement._

**2. Embark Behavioral Health (DR 55 | 4,651 keywords | 41,873 monthly traffic)**
Founded 1995, headquartered in Chandler, AZ. Nationwide network of 30+ outpatient and inpatient programs. PE-backed by Consonance Capital Partners, expanding aggressively into integrated care and outpatient. Plans to increase severity range of conditions treated and add technology support. CEO Scott Filion, Chief Clinical Officer Dr. Sharnell Myles.

**3. The Ridge RTC (DR 26 | 905 keywords | 7,709 monthly traffic) — BENCHMARK COMPETITOR**
Most instructive competitor for Silver State. Similar domain authority level but pulling 20x the traffic. Based in New Hampshire/Maine. Content strategy drives success — condition-specific blog posts on autism, neurodivergent symptoms, and teen-specific mental health topics dominate rankings.
_Key SEO Strategy: Informational content on specific conditions ("signs of autism in teens" = 946 traffic, "neurodivergent symptoms" = 430 traffic, "smiling depression" = 92 traffic). Location pages for each state served. Strong position for "teen treatment center" (#3, 236 traffic), "teen rtc" (#1, 201 traffic), "teen ptsd treatment" (#1, 61 traffic)._

**4. Evolve Treatment Centers (DR 49 | 2,297 keywords | 5,483 monthly traffic)**
Mid-market competitor with solid keyword portfolio but moderate traffic yield, indicating optimization opportunities they're missing.

**Local Las Vegas Competitors:**

**5. Moriah Behavioral Health (Local — Las Vegas)**
Direct local competitor with teen residential programs. Blog-heavy SEO strategy driving traffic through informational pharmaceutical content ("best time to take lexapro for anxiety" = 142 traffic, "food aversion" = 100 traffic). However, most traffic comes from non-treatment-specific queries — weak on direct treatment conversion keywords. Warm, family-oriented positioning.

**6. Desert Parkway Behavioral Healthcare Hospital (Las Vegas)**
Adolescent inpatient programming for ages 13-17. Hospital-based model, not residential. Different level of care than Silver State.

**7. Seven Hills Hospital (Las Vegas)**
Psychiatric acute treatment for all ages including children & adolescents. Hospital setting, acute care focus.

**8. Desert Willow Treatment Center (State-operated)**
Licensed 32-bed psychiatric hospital, Joint Commission accredited. State-operated through DCFS, serving children statewide. Not a private competitor but part of the ecosystem.

### Market Share and Competitive Positioning

**Silver State's Current Digital Position:**

| Metric | Silver State | The Ridge (Benchmark) | Newport (Leader) |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Domain Rating | Low | 26 | 71 |
| Organic Keywords | 145 | 905 | 6,411 |
| Monthly Traffic | 353 | 7,709 | 40,322 |
| Top 3 Rankings | 20 | ~150 (est.) | ~1,500 (est.) |
| Location Pages | 0 | 2+ (state pages) | 8+ (location pages) |
| Insurance Pages | 1 (general) | Unknown | Yes |
| Blog Content | ~10 posts | 30+ articles | 100+ resources |

**Competitive Positioning Map:**
- **Newport Academy** = Premium national brand. Outcome-validated. Multi-location. High trust.
- **Embark BH** = Scale-focused. PE-backed. Expanding aggressively.
- **The Ridge RTC** = Content-driven growth. Single-region. Similar authority to Silver State but far better execution.
- **Moriah BH** = Local Las Vegas. Blog-heavy but non-converting content. Informational strategy.
- **Silver State** = Local Las Vegas. Strong niche positioning (LGBTQIA+, dual diagnosis). Untapped potential — already ranking for valuable keywords with minimal optimization.

_Value Proposition Mapping:_
- Newport/Embark: "National expertise, proven outcomes, insurance-friendly"
- The Ridge: "Specialized residential care, education on conditions"
- Moriah: "Local expertise, family-oriented, mental health education"
- **Silver State Opportunity**: "Local Las Vegas expertise, specialized adolescent residential, LGBTQIA+-affirming, dual diagnosis, family-centered — with outcome data and accreditation trust signals"

### Competitive Strategies and Differentiation

**What's Working for Competitors:**

1. **Content Pillar Strategy (The Ridge/Newport)** — Condition-specific content pages driving massive informational traffic. The Ridge gets 946 visits/month from a single "signs of autism in teens" article. Newport gets 1,817 from "scromiting."

2. **Location Page Strategy (Newport)** — Dedicated pages per location driving both branded and "near me" searches. "Newport Academy Connecticut" alone brings 369 monthly visits.

3. **Outcome Validation (Newport)** — Third-party research through Vanderbilt University creates unbeatable E-E-A-T signals and conversion trust.

4. **Quiz/Assessment Funnels (Newport)** — "Anxiety test for teens" drives 231 monthly visits as top-of-funnel engagement, capturing leads before they're ready to call.

5. **Pharmaceutical/Medication Content (Moriah)** — Lexapro-related content driving 300+ monthly visits from families already researching treatment options.

**What Silver State Can Exploit:**

1. **Local SEO Dominance** — No competitor has aggressively targeted "Las Vegas" + treatment keywords. Nevada ranks 51st for youth mental health access — families are desperate and searching.
2. **LGBTQIA+ Niche** — Already ranking #3 for "lgbtq adolescent residential treatment" (Vol 1,200, KD 0). No competitor owns this space with local positioning.
3. **Insurance-Specific Pages** — High-intent, low-competition keywords (detailed below).
4. **Dual Diagnosis Positioning** — Already ranking #2 for key dual diagnosis terms.

### Business Models and Value Propositions

**Revenue Model (Adolescent Residential Treatment):**
- Primary: Insurance reimbursement (private insurance, Medicaid, TRICARE)
- Secondary: Private pay / out-of-network
- Average cost of teen residential treatment: $10,000-$30,000/month (varies by program)
- Admissions driven by: direct family search (30-40%), referral networks (30-40%), digital marketing (20-30%)

**Website's Role in Revenue:**
- Insurance verification/VOB is the #1 conversion action for treatment center websites
- 78% of addiction-related searches happen on mobile devices
- Most treatment center websites operate at 20-40% of potential effectiveness
- Funnel optimization improves conversion rates by 20-35%
- Trust optimization (accreditation badges, outcome data, reviews) improves conversion by 25-40%
- Average treatment center website loads in 8-12 seconds; Google threshold is 2.5 seconds — speed is a competitive advantage

### Insurance Page SEO Opportunity (Silver's Request)

**Insurance Keywords — Priority Targets:**

| Keyword | Volume | KD | CPC | Strategy |
|---------|--------|-----|-----|----------|
| does medicaid cover rehab | 400 | 9 | $3.00 | Dedicated Medicaid page |

| does blue cross cover rehab | 30 | **2** | $13.00 | Dedicated BCBS page |
| blue cross rehab coverage | 20 | **0** | $17.00 | Same BCBS page |

**Recommended Insurance Page Structure:**
Each insurance provider gets its own dedicated page optimized for `{insurance} + teen treatment + Las Vegas`:
1. `/insurance/aetna/` — "Does Aetna Cover Teen Treatment in Las Vegas?"
2. `/insurance/cigna/` — "Cigna Teen Mental Health Coverage — Las Vegas, NV"
3. `/insurance/blue-cross-blue-shield/` — "BCBS Teen Residential Treatment Coverage"
4. `/insurance/ambetter/` — "Ambetter Teen Mental Health Treatment Coverage"
5. `/insurance/humana/` — "Humana Adolescent Treatment Coverage — Nevada"
6. `/insurance/united-healthcare/` — "UnitedHealthcare Teen Rehab Coverage"
7. `/insurance/tricare/` — "TRICARE Teen Treatment Coverage — Las Vegas"
8. `/insurance/medicaid/` — "Does Nevada Medicaid Cover Teen Residential Treatment?"
9. `/insurance/anthem/` — "Anthem Teen Mental Health Treatment Coverage"
10. Hub page: `/insurance/` — "Insurance We Accept for Teen Treatment in Las Vegas"

**Combined estimated monthly search opportunity: 1,500-2,000+ searches across all insurance terms, with KD 0-11 and CPCs indicating extremely high conversion intent.**

### Competitive Dynamics and Entry Barriers

**Barriers to Digital Competition:**
- **Accreditation Requirements**: Joint Commission/CARF accreditation takes months to obtain but is table-stakes for credibility
- **LegitScript Certification**: Required to run Google Ads for treatment services — immediate barrier for any new competitor
- **E-E-A-T for Healthcare**: Google's quality guidelines demand demonstrated expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness for health content (YMYL - Your Money Your Life)
- **Backlink Authority**: Building domain rating takes years. Silver State's 276 referring domains from quality sources (prnewswire.com DR 92, theglobeandmail.com DR 90) is a solid foundation
- **Content Depth**: Competing nationally requires hundreds of pages of quality clinical content
- **Insurance Network Credentialing**: Lengthy process to get in-network with major insurers

**Market Consolidation:**
PE firms are actively acquiring and consolidating behavioral health providers. Consonance Capital Partners acquired majority stake in Embark BH. This trend creates opportunity for differentiated local operators who provide what consolidated nationals cannot — genuine local presence, community relationships, and personalized care.

**Switching Costs:**
Low for families pre-admission (they shop extensively). High post-admission (disrupting a teen's treatment is avoided). This means: **the website must win the pre-admission research phase.** Families compare 3-5 centers before calling. The website that answers their questions fastest, displays the most trust signals, and makes insurance verification easiest wins the call.

### Ecosystem and Partnership Analysis

**Referral Network Ecosystem:**
- **Clinical Referrers**: Therapists, psychiatrists, pediatricians, school counselors — 30-40% of admissions
- **Directory Platforms**: Recovery.com, Psychology Today, SAMHSA locator — critical for visibility
- **Insurance Networks**: In-network status is the #1 driver of whether a family will contact a center
- **State Agencies**: Nevada DCFS, Clark County Juvenile Justice Services — referral pipeline for high-acuity cases
- **National Associations**: NAATP membership, Joint Commission listing — credibility and referral channels

**Technology Ecosystem:**
- **Google Ads (via LegitScript)**: Mandatory for paid acquisition in treatment space
- **Google Business Profile**: Critical for local pack rankings — "teen treatment near me" searches
- **Schema Markup**: LocalBusiness, MedicalOrganization, HealthcareService schemas signal relevance to Google
- **Review Platforms**: Google Reviews, Yelp, Trustpilot — social proof in decision-making
- **Call Tracking**: Essential for attribution — most conversions happen via phone call, not form fill

**Distribution Channels (Patient Acquisition):**
1. Organic Search (SEO) — Lowest CAC, highest lifetime value
2. Paid Search (Google Ads via LegitScript) — Immediate traffic, high CPC ($14-70 for insurance terms)
3. Directory Listings — Recovery.com, Psychology Today, SAMHSA
4. Referral Networks — Therapists, schools, pediatricians
5. Social Media — Awareness/education, not direct conversion
6. PR/Media — Backlink building + brand awareness

### Compliance Frameworks

**Google E-E-A-T / YMYL Framework (SEO Compliance):**

This is not a legal regulation but is **functionally mandatory** for healthcare SEO. Google classifies behavioral health content as YMYL (Your Money Your Life), imposing the strictest content quality requirements:

- **Experience**: Content must demonstrate firsthand clinical experience, not just theoretical knowledge. Staff bios with credentials, years of practice, and specializations are essential.
- **Expertise**: Medical claims require expert review and approval. Writers can draft; clinicians must review and sign off.
- **Authoritativeness**: Accreditation badges, outcome data, third-party validation, citations from WHO, CDC, SAMHSA, PubMed.
- **Trustworthiness**: HTTPS, clear privacy policy, visible contact information, no deceptive claims, proper disclosure of financial relationships.

**Implementation Requirements for Silver State's Website:**
- Every clinical content page must have a named, credentialed author/reviewer
- Medical claims must cite trusted sources (CDC, SAMHSA, NIDA, peer-reviewed journals)
- Staff credential pages with photos, titles, license numbers, specializations
- Schema markup: MedicalOrganization, Physician, MedicalCondition, MedicalTherapy
- Visible accreditation badges on every page (header or footer)
- Clear editorial review process documented and visible

### Data Protection and Privacy

**Website Tracking Restrictions:**
HHS has issued explicit guidance on online tracking technologies for HIPAA-covered entities:

- **Tracking pixels (Facebook Pixel, Google Analytics, marketing pixels) on pages containing health information face significant restrictions**
- Many health websites unknowingly violate HIPAA by including tracking scripts that leak health-related behavioral data to third parties
- Marketing pixels must be removed from authenticated/password-protected pages (patient portals)
- Tracking technologies on user-authenticated pages have access to PHI including IP addresses, medical record numbers, email addresses, appointment dates
- Regulated entities must configure pages to allow tracking technologies to **only use and disclose PHI in compliance with HIPAA Privacy Rule**

**Practical Impact on Silver State's Website:**
- Use **HIPAA-compliant analytics** (e.g., server-side tracking, Matomo, or HIPAA-compliant Google Analytics configuration)
- Do NOT place Facebook Pixel or standard Google Ads conversion tracking on pages where users submit health information (contact forms, insurance verification forms)
- Implement proper **cookie consent management** with opt-in for non-essential tracking
- Contact forms must use encrypted transmission (TLS) and store data in HIPAA-compliant systems
- BAAs required with all technology vendors handling user data

**42 CFR Part 2 Website Impact:**
- Any form that collects substance use disorder information requires explicit patient consent
- Consent tracking must be documented and auditable
- **Compliance deadline: February 16, 2026**

### Licensing and Certification

**FTC Advertising Guidelines (Treatment Center Websites):**
The Federal Trade Commission imposes strict requirements on health-related advertising claims:

- All claims must be truthful, cannot be deceptive or unfair, and must be evidence-based
- Advertisers must have **adequate substantiation for all objective claims** before publishing
- **Testimonials**: Cannot make claims through testimonials that would be deceptive if made directly. Must have scientific evidence backing implied claims that treatment will work for others as it did for the endorser
- **Unrepresentative testimonials** may be misleading if not accompanied by information about typical results
- **Material connections** (payments, free services) between advertisers and endorsers must be disclosed
- **Health claims require "competent and reliable scientific evidence"** — generally randomized controlled human clinical testing

**Website Implications:**
- Testimonials page must include disclaimer about typical results
- Outcome statistics must be substantiated (third-party validation preferred)
- Staff/expert endorsements must disclose any material connections
- Avoid absolute claims ("we cure depression") — use evidence-based language ("our evidence-based approach has shown...")
- Document clinical evidence supporting all treatment effectiveness claims

### Implementation Considerations

**ADA Website Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) — MANDATORY DEADLINE:**

On **May 11, 2026**, a federal compliance deadline takes effect requiring every healthcare provider website to be ADA compliant:

- Applies to ALL organizations accepting Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP payments — this includes Silver State
- Must conform to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards
- Covers: websites (scheduling, provider directories, patient education, billing, contact), mobile apps, and kiosks
- **Four principles**: content must be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR)
- **Enforcement**: OCR can investigate complaints, conduct proactive reviews, and refer to DOJ. Consequence is suspension/termination of federal financial assistance (Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements)

**WCAG 2.1 AA Key Requirements for Silver State's Build:**
- Sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Keyboard navigability for all interactive elements
- Alt text on all images
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Skip navigation links
- Form labels and error identification
- No content that flashes more than 3 times per second
- Text resizable to 200% without loss of content
- Captions/transcripts for video/audio content

**This is a non-negotiable build requirement** — Silver State's React rebuild must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant from day one.

## Technical Trends and Innovation

### Emerging Technologies

**AI in Behavioral Health (2025-2026):**
The AI in mental health market is on track to grow from $1.71B in 2025 to $9.12B by 2033. Key developments:
- 1 in 3 adults has already used an AI chatbot for mental health support
- 92.7% of young users found AI mental health advice helpful (RAND 2025 study)
- Talkspace launching LLM-driven mental health chatbot in 2026
- OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health linking patient portals and health data
- Administrative AI reclaiming 10-15 hours weekly on paperwork (scheduling, billing, intake, insurance verification)
- Organizations using AI daily jumped from 15% (2024) to 29% (2025)

**Schema Markup & Structured Data:**
Over 90% of top-ranking healthcare pages use schema markup. Critical types for Silver State:
- `MedicalOrganization` — primary entity markup
- `LocalBusiness` — nested within MedicalOrganization for local discovery
- `MedicalCondition` — for each condition treated
- `MedicalTherapy` — for each therapy/program offered
- `Physician` / `MedicalWebPage` — for staff and content pages
- `FAQPage` — for FAQ sections (rich snippet eligibility)
- JSON-LD format (Google's preferred method)

As voice search and AI-generated answers grow, schema acts as a reliable data feed — the more complete the markup, the better the chances of being featured in AI Overviews and voice responses.

### Digital Transformation

**Treatment Center Website Architecture (2026 Best Practices):**
- **Headless CMS + React/Next.js** is the emerging standard for healthcare organizations. Silver State's existing React + Vite stack is modern but lacks SSR/SSG capabilities critical for SEO
- Healthcare organizations treating content infrastructure as a strategic asset — powering patient onboarding, multilingual education, and regulatory compliance
- Leading CMS options for healthcare: Sanity, Storyblok, Contentful, Payload (open-source)
- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) enables fast page loads + fresh content — critical when Google's threshold is 2.5s and treatment center average is 8-12s

**Current Stack Assessment (Silver State):**
- React 19 + Vite = excellent for SPA but **no server-side rendering** — potential SEO limitation for content-heavy pages
- Data-driven architecture (content.ts) is a strength — content already separated from components
- GSAP + Framer Motion animations must be performance-optimized (LCP/CLS impact)
- Consider: static pre-rendering for critical SEO pages while maintaining SPA experience for interactive sections

### Innovation Patterns

**Local SEO Evolution (2026):**
- Google Business Profile is no longer just local SEO — it's become a trusted data source for AI systems evaluating local businesses
- Each service page must target: specific problem + specific location + specific audience
- Service area pages (e.g., "Teen Treatment in Henderson, NV", "Adolescent Rehab Near Summerlin") capture long-tail searches that main location pages miss
- GBP in 2026 reads more like an educational resource than promotional listing
- Must claim profiles on: GBP, Bing Places, Apple Maps + specialty directories (SAMHSA locator, Recovery.com, Psychology Today, Healthgrades)

**GEO-SEO Strategy for Silver State:**
Service area pages targeting Las Vegas metro communities:
1. `/locations/las-vegas/` — "Teen Treatment Center in Las Vegas, NV"
2. `/locations/henderson/` — "Adolescent Treatment in Henderson, Nevada"
3. `/locations/north-las-vegas/` — "Teen Mental Health Treatment — North Las Vegas"
4. `/locations/summerlin/` — "Teen Residential Treatment Near Summerlin"
5. `/locations/clark-county/` — "Clark County Adolescent Mental Health Services"
6. Hub: `/locations/` — "Serving the Las Vegas Valley and Southern Nevada"

### Future Outlook

**The Convergence of AI, E-E-A-T, and Healthcare SEO:**
- Google's September 2025 update further tightened YMYL requirements — recovery for impacted healthcare sites takes 6-12 months
- AI Overviews are reshaping search behavior — schema markup and authoritative content determine inclusion
- Google actively devaluing AI-generated content in healthcare verticals — human expertise and local specificity required
- Measurement-based care (outcome data) becoming a ranking signal proxy — sites publishing verified outcomes will outperform

**For Silver State's Build:**
The website must be built as a **trust engine** — not just a brochure. Every page should answer: "Why should I trust this center with my child?" The technical foundation (schema, speed, accessibility, HIPAA compliance) combined with clinical credibility (named staff, outcome data, accreditation badges) creates an unbeatable E-E-A-T profile that competitors in the Las Vegas market are not executing on.

### Implementation Opportunities

**Immediate High-Impact Technical Wins:**

| Opportunity | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Schema markup (MedicalOrganization + LocalBusiness) | HIGH — rich snippets + AI visibility | LOW | P0 |
| WCAG 2.1 AA compliance baked into build | HIGH — legal requirement by May 2026 | MEDIUM | P0 |
| HIPAA-compliant analytics setup | HIGH — avoid violations | LOW | P0 |
| Insurance verification form (secure, no tracking pixels) | HIGH — primary conversion action | MEDIUM | P0 |
| Service area pages (5-6 geo-targeted pages) | HIGH — local pack dominance | LOW | P1 |
| Individual insurance provider pages (9-10 pages) | HIGH — high-intent keyword capture | LOW | P1 |
| Staff credential pages with schema | HIGH — E-E-A-T signals | LOW | P1 |
| FAQ schema on condition/program pages | MEDIUM — rich snippet eligibility | LOW | P2 |
| Blog content strategy (condition-specific articles) | HIGH — informational traffic growth | ONGOING | P2 |

### Challenges and Risks

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| React SPA may limit SEO crawlability | Pre-render critical pages; consider SSG for content pages |
| GSAP animations may impact Core Web Vitals (LCP/CLS) | Lazy-load animations, ensure content renders before animation triggers |
| HIPAA-compliant analytics limits tracking capability | Use server-side tracking, privacy-first analytics (Matomo/Plausible) |
| Content volume needed to compete (60+ pages) | Prioritize by keyword opportunity; build in phases |
| Maintaining LegitScript certification for ads | Budget $3,095/year; maintain compliance documentation |

---

## Recommendations

### Technology Adoption Strategy

1. **Keep React + Vite stack** — the existing component library is rich and the team knows it. Consider adding a pre-rendering solution (e.g., vite-plugin-ssr or react-snap) for SEO-critical pages rather than migrating to Next.js
2. **Implement comprehensive schema markup** from day one — JSON-LD for MedicalOrganization, LocalBusiness, MedicalCondition, MedicalTherapy, FAQPage
3. **HIPAA-compliant analytics** — evaluate Matomo (self-hosted), Plausible, or properly configured server-side Google Analytics with no client-side health data leakage
4. **Build WCAG 2.1 AA into the component library** — accessibility-first approach is cheaper than retrofitting
5. **Structured content architecture** — the data-driven approach in content.ts is a strength; extend it to support all new page types (insurance, locations, conditions)

### Innovation Roadmap

**Week 1-2 (Foundation):**
- Architecture planning with SEO, accessibility, and compliance baked in
- Schema markup strategy defined
- Analytics solution selected and configured
- Content structure for all page types designed

**Week 3-4 (Core Pages):**
- Treatment services hub page
- Location/service area pages (5-6)
- Insurance hub + individual insurance pages (9-10)
- Admissions/conversion funnel pages

**Week 5+ (Growth Content):**
- Condition-specific pages (rebuild from WordPress)
- Program/therapy pages (rebuild from WordPress)
- Blog content targeting identified keyword opportunities
- Staff credential pages

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Compliance First** — WCAG 2.1 AA and HIPAA compliance are non-negotiable build requirements, not post-launch fixes
2. **Content Review Process** — All clinical content requires named credentialed reviewer before publishing (E-E-A-T + FTC)
3. **Tracking Audit** — Zero marketing pixels on any page containing health forms or collecting health information
4. **LegitScript Timeline** — If not already certified, begin application immediately (2-4 month lead time before ads can run)
5. **Performance Budget** — Set Core Web Vitals targets (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, FID < 100ms) and test against them throughout development
