# Product Brief: silverstate

## Executive Summary

Silver State Adolescent Treatment Center is rebuilding its digital presence from an underperforming WordPress site into a high-performance React-based lead generation platform. The current site generates approximately 353 monthly organic visits with 145 ranking keywords — operating at roughly 5% of its addressable potential in a $96.9B U.S. behavioral health market where Nevada ranks dead last for youth mental health access.

The new site will serve as a conversion-optimized trust engine and hub magnet — the definitive resource for every question a Las Vegas family has about adolescent treatment. Built on existing React UI components and real content extracted from the WordPress site, the fully-structured, SEO-ready foundation ships in week one using a Lego assembly model: components + content + information architecture = launch. Continuous improvement over 6-8 months builds on this foundation with expanded content, deeper optimization, and data-driven refinement targeting 85% census through high-fit family acquisition.

The primary conversion action is phone calls to (725) 525-9897. Every page on the site serves one purpose: move a family closer to picking up the phone.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Silver State's current WordPress website fails to convert the families who need its services most. The site is poorly structured, slow, and doesn't reflect the clinical quality of a Joint Commission Gold Seal accredited facility with a 4.8/5 rating. In a market where families compare 3-5 treatment centers before making a single call, and 78% of addiction-related searches happen on mobile, Silver State's digital presence is losing potential admissions daily to competitors with stronger websites and weaker clinical programs.

### Problem Impact

- **Families can't find Silver State** — 353 monthly visits vs. 7,700+ for comparable competitor The Ridge RTC, and 40,000+ for market leaders
- **Nevada's crisis is Silver State's opportunity gap** — The state ranks 51st for youth mental health access (22%+ major depressive episodes vs. 11% national average), creating massive unmet demand that Silver State is positioned to serve but can't reach digitally
- **Revenue left on the table** — An estimated 23,000+ monthly addressable searches across treatment, insurance, and location keywords remain uncaptured
- **The current site undermines trust** — In an industry transitioning from "growth mode" to "proof mode," a dated website signals clinical weakness to families making life-or-death decisions about their children

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

The current WordPress site was thrown together without a cohesive conversion strategy, SEO architecture, or compliance framework. It lacks:

- Structured page hierarchy for SEO (no individual insurance pages, no location/service area pages, no condition-specific pages)
- Schema markup for healthcare entities (MedicalOrganization, LocalBusiness, FAQPage)
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance (mandatory by May 2026)
- HIPAA-compliant analytics and form handling
- A clear conversion funnel driving families from search to phone call
- The visual and emotional quality that matches the clinical care Silver State actually provides

### Proposed Solution

A ground-up React website rebuild using Silver State's existing UI component library — featuring parallax hero sections, scroll-triggered animations, card stacks, timeline layouts, and drag-scroll carousels — assembled with real content from the WordPress site and architected as a hub magnet for adolescent treatment in Las Vegas.

**Build Philosophy: Lego Assembly Model**
Components exist. Content exists. Information architecture is defined by domain research. The foundation ships in week one with full URL structure, schema markup, semantic HTML, and conversion CTAs on every page. Content depth and optimization improve continuously over 6-8 months based on real traffic data and ranking performance.

**Conversion Architecture: Emotional Journey = Conversion Funnel**
The site's conversion architecture mirrors the emotional journey of a parent in crisis:

1. **"I'm not alone"** — Hero copy validates their fear and urgency
2. **"These people understand my child"** — Who-this-is-for section mirrors their teen's specific struggle
3. **"This is real, safe, and credible"** — Accreditations, staff credentials, daily schedule, outcome signals
4. **"I know exactly what to do next"** — Admissions process, phone call CTA, zero dead-end pages

Every scroll depth maps to a stage of emotional readiness. Every page on the site — homepage, insurance page, condition page, location page — follows this arc.

**Six Pillars:**

1. **SEO Foundation** — Structured page architecture targeting 23,000+ monthly searches across treatment conditions, insurance providers, and Las Vegas metro service areas. URL structure locked from day one. Every page ships with proper meta tags, heading hierarchy, and internal linking.
2. **GEO Authority** — Service area pages, Google Business Profile optimization, and schema markup positioning Silver State as THE Las Vegas adolescent treatment provider
3. **Conversion-First Design** — Every page funnels to the primary action: call (725) 525-9897. Phone call CTAs above the fold, after every content section, and in persistent elements. Zero dead-end pages.
4. **Trust Engine** — Joint Commission Gold Seal, LegitScript, HIPAA compliance badges visible on every page. Staff credentials with schema markup. Accreditation and outcome signals front and center.
5. **Performance** — Core Web Vitals optimized (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1). Content renders first, animations enhance second. Built for the 78% of users searching on mobile.
6. **Compliance-Ready** — WCAG 2.1 AA semantic HTML and accessibility from the component level. HIPAA-compliant analytics. FTC-compliant testimonials. 42 CFR Part 2 consent mechanisms.

### Key Differentiators

- **Only adolescent-focused residential treatment center in Las Vegas** aggressively pursuing digital market ownership
- **Hub magnet positioning** — the definitive answer for every question a Las Vegas family has about teen treatment, insurance coverage, conditions, and the admissions process
- **LGBTQIA+ affirming care** — already ranking #3 for "lgbtq adolescent residential treatment" (Vol 1,200, KD 0) with zero optimization
- **Dual diagnosis specialization** — already ranking for key dual diagnosis terms
- **Full continuum of care** — Residential, PHP, IOP under one roof with on-site accredited academics (Silver State Youth Academy)
- **"Proof mode" ready** — Joint Commission accredited, 4.8/5 ratings, named clinical leadership (Dr. Russ Park, Arianne Smith), 4:1 staff-to-client ratio
- **The website IS the competitive advantage** — No competitor in the Las Vegas market is executing on modern web standards, schema markup, or conversion-optimized page architecture. A gold-standard site immediately positions Silver State as the credibility leader.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

**Persona 1: "The Searching Parent" — Maria, 43**
*The primary website user and conversion target*

Maria's teen has been struggling for months — maybe years. Outpatient therapy helped for a while but things have escalated. She's been told by a therapist, school counselor, or her own gut instinct that residential treatment might be the right step. She's scared, overwhelmed, and searching.

- **Search behavior:** "teen treatment center Las Vegas," "adolescent residential treatment near me," "does Aetna cover teen rehab," "signs my teen needs residential treatment"
- **Emotional state:** Fear, guilt ("did I wait too long?"), overwhelm, hope mixed with skepticism
- **Decision drivers:** Accreditation/trust signals, insurance coverage clarity, seeing her specific child reflected in the content ("the anxious teen who can't make it through a school day"), knowing what a day looks like, understanding the admissions process won't be another maze
- **Device:** 78% mobile. She's searching from her car, her office, her bed at night
- **Conversion trigger:** The moment she feels "these people understand my kid and I know exactly what to do next" — she calls
- **Success moment:** She picks up the phone and hears a human voice that validates everything the website promised

**Persona 2: "The Insurance-First Parent" — David, 47**
*High-intent, bottom-of-funnel user*

David already knows his teen needs treatment. He may have already talked to a facility or two. His #1 question right now is: "Can I afford this?" He's searching insurance-specific terms because cost is the gatekeeper.

- **Search behavior:** "does Cigna cover teen residential treatment," "Aetna rehab coverage Las Vegas," "how much does teen rehab cost with insurance"
- **Emotional state:** Pragmatic urgency — he's past the "does my kid need this" phase and into "how do I make this happen"
- **Decision drivers:** Clear insurance coverage information, verification process simplicity, out-of-pocket transparency, speed of the process
- **Device:** Desktop and mobile, often during work hours
- **Conversion trigger:** An insurance page that answers his exact question + a frictionless path to verify coverage by phone
- **Success moment:** "They verified my insurance in 10 minutes and told me exactly what's covered"

**Persona 3: "The Condition-Specific Parent" — Rachel, 39**
*Informational entry point, mid-funnel user*

Rachel's teen has a specific diagnosis — anxiety, trauma/PTSD, dual diagnosis, an eating disorder. She's searching for treatment that specializes in that specific thing. Generic "teen treatment" content won't convince her. She needs to see that Silver State treats her child's exact condition with clinical expertise.

- **Search behavior:** "teen PTSD treatment Las Vegas," "adolescent dual diagnosis residential," "LGBTQ teen treatment center," "teen eating disorder treatment Nevada"
- **Emotional state:** Focused and researching — she's educating herself before she decides
- **Decision drivers:** Condition-specific expertise, named clinical staff with relevant credentials, evidence-based therapies listed, specificity over generality
- **Device:** Mixed — desktop for deep research, mobile for quick searches
- **Conversion trigger:** A condition page that demonstrates deep clinical understanding + "call to discuss your teen's specific situation"
- **Success moment:** "They don't just treat everything — they actually specialize in what my kid is dealing with"

### Secondary Users

**Clinical Referrers** — Therapists, psychiatrists, school counselors, pediatricians who recommend treatment centers to families. They drive 30-40% of admissions industry-wide. They need the website to confirm credibility (Joint Commission, staff credentials, programs) so they feel confident in their referral. They may send a link directly to the parent.

**State/Court Referrals** — Nevada DCFS, Clark County Juvenile Justice Services, and court-ordered placements represent a referral pipeline. These users need to verify licensing, accreditation, and program specifics quickly.

### User Journey

**The Website Conversion Journey (All Personas):**

| Stage | User Experience | Website Delivers |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Discovery** | Searches Google from a place of fear or urgency | SEO-optimized pages rank for their exact query — condition, insurance, or location-specific |
| **First Impression** (0-5 sec) | "Does this feel safe and credible?" | Warm, professional design. Accreditation badges visible. No pop-ups, no hard sell. |
| **Validation** (5-30 sec) | "Do they understand my child?" | Who-this-is-for profiles, condition-specific content, age range confirmation (11-17) |
| **Trust Building** (30-120 sec) | "Is this real? Are they qualified?" | Joint Commission Gold Seal, staff credentials, daily schedule, 4:1 ratio, 4.8/5 rating |
| **Conversion Readiness** | "What do I do?" | Clear admissions process (4 steps), prominent phone CTA, insurance verification nudge |
| **Action** | Picks up the phone | Click-to-call on mobile, phone number visible on every page, 24/7 availability stated |

### Business Objectives

**Client-Facing (Silver State):**
- **Primary:** 85% census maintained through consistent admissions pipeline
- **Leading indicator:** Monthly call volume from website (organic) trending upward
- **Proof point:** Admissions attributable to organic web traffic via call tracking

**Agency-Facing (Comcreate — proving the build's value):**

- **Proof point:** "X% of total calls came from organic search, not paid campaigns"
- **Strategic:** Position Silver State's digital presence as a case study in treatment center web performance

### Key Performance Indicators

**SEO / Traffic KPIs:**

| KPI | Baseline (Current) | 3-Month Target | 6-Month Target |
|-----|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Organic monthly traffic | 353 | 2,000+ | 7,500+ |
| Ranking keywords | 145 | 400+ | 900+ |
| Top 10 rankings | ~20 | 75+ | 200+ |
| Pages indexed | ~15 | 50+ | 75+ |

**Conversion KPIs:**

| KPI | Measurement Method | Target |

| Calls from non-paid sources | Call tracking (exclude paid) | Demonstrate organic > paid over time |
| Call-to-page attribution | Call tracking per landing page | Identify top-converting pages |
| Click-to-call rate (mobile) | Event tracking | > 3% of mobile sessions |

**Technical KPIs:**

| KPI | Target | Why It Matters |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | < 2.5s | Google ranking signal + user experience |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | < 0.1 | No janky animations pushing content around |
| Mobile usability score | 100% pages pass | 78% of searches are mobile |
| WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | 100% pages pass | Legal requirement by May 2026 |
| Schema markup coverage | 100% pages | Rich snippets + AI visibility |

**GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) KPIs:**

| KPI | Measurement Method | Target |
|-----|-------------------|--------|
| AI Overview citations | Track Silver State appearances in Google AI Overviews for target queries | Present in AI Overviews for top 10 treatment keywords by month 6 |
| LLM citation rate | Monitor mentions in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini responses for Las Vegas treatment queries | Consistent citation as a named provider |
| AI-referred traffic | Analytics segment for traffic from AI platforms (Perplexity referrals, ChatGPT link clicks) | Track and grow as distinct channel |
| Schema markup completeness | Audit structured data coverage (MedicalOrganization, LocalBusiness, MedicalCondition, FAQPage, Physician) | 100% of pages with complete JSON-LD |
| E-E-A-T signal density | Named credentialed authors, accreditation badges, clinical citations per page | Every page carries trust signals AI systems can parse |
| FAQ schema coverage | FAQPage markup on condition/program/insurance pages | Rich snippet eligibility + AI answer sourcing |
| Topical authority depth | Pages covering the full topic cluster (conditions, therapies, insurance, locations, admissions) | Hub magnet = the most comprehensive source AI can reference |

**The GEO System:**
The site architecture IS the GEO system — not a bolt-on. Schema markup provides the machine-readable feed. Topical authority makes Silver State the most complete source. E-E-A-T signals (named clinical staff, Joint Commission accreditation, published credentials) determine who AI cites. FAQ content maps directly to how users query AI systems. Local specificity beats generic national content in AI responses.

**Dual Metric Narrative:**
- For Silver State: *"Your census is at 85% and here's the call volume driving it."*
- For Comcreate: *"We took a site from 353 organic visits to 7,500+ in 6 months. Here's the traffic NOT from paid — that's the site we built, compounding month over month. And here's the AI-referred traffic — a channel your competitors don't even know exists yet."*
